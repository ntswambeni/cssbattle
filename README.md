# cssbattle
-This is a repo for my css battle solutions
-I am just practicing css, not trying to top the leader board with less chars solutions
-I am not doing inline style or using bgcolor instead of background-color and other stuff to reduce chars
-Task one and two are the only solutions with inline css - I didn't like what I saw so I stopped

# presentation
-Each chalenge has its own html file
